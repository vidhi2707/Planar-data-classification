# Planar-data-classification
In this repo, I've written a code to make a nueral network with one hidden layer to classify the planar data, i.e, classifying red and blue dots. In the hidden layer, tanh aactivation is used whereas in the last layer sigmoid function is used as we are interested in binary classification.
